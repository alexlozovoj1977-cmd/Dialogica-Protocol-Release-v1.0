DIALOGICA (v1.0) Operational Truth Protocol for Human–AI Co-Thinking
"Truth is not a value. Truth is a structural constant."
What is Dialogica? Dialogica is an operational protocol for stabilizing reasoning in hybrid 
Human + AI cognitive systems. It introduces a six-dimensional architecture (D0–D6) that 
prevents:
AI hallucinations
Human cognitive bias amplification
Logical drift in long reasoning chains
Ethical distortion under pressure
Dialogica is already applied in multi-domain research: from applied physics to harmonic signal 
processing (HMC Phase Trap) and cognitive system design.
The Protocol (D0–D6) D0 — Context Define the problem space and system boundary. A 
thought without a boundary cannot be true.
D1 — Factology Separate:
F – Facts
I – Interpretations
N – Normative assumptions
U – Unknowns
No reasoning step may exceed the strength of its factual base.
D2 — Structure Map causal links, actors, attractors, and feedback loops. Prevent chaotic drift.
D3 — Chronos Model temporal evolution: t?? ? t? ? t?? Truth is a trajectory, not a moment.
D4 — Ethics of Truth The Hard Invariant. Any solution that increases distortion dies in long-
term entropy. Truth is treated like a conservation law.
D5 — Reflexivity Correct both:
Human biases
AI generative patterns
Maintain a clean cognitive mirror.
D6 — Synthesis Decision crystallization: A final answer that survives all six filters.

Quick Start Copy DIALOGIC-LOG-TEMPLATE.md into your project.
Fill in D0 (Context) and D1 (Factology).
Use D2–D5 to stabilize reasoning.
Produce a truth-first decision in D6.
Dialogica sessions can be run manually or automated via JSON schema.
Citation Please cite according to CITATION.cff.
